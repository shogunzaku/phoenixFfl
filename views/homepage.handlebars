      <p>Youth tackle football athletes experienced a median of 378 head impacts per athlete during the season.
Flag football athletes experienced a median of 8 eight head impacts per athlete during the season.
These findings suggest that non-contact or flag football programs may be a safer alternative for reducing head impacts and concussion risk for youth football athletes under age 14.</p>
